Thanks to TÃ©rcio Martins a package for Arch Linux is available in the [AUR].

## SDL2

The [SDL2] branch contains the SDL2 version with hardware rendering support.
Altough considered as *experimental*, it is recommended for 64-bit operating
systems (SDL2 binaries and packages above are build on the *master* branch).

The SDL2 version is available in Valerio Lupi's fork of the [RetroPie-Setup].
