To build for Linux:
-------------------
SDLTRS needs the development files of libSDL 1.2, X11 and GNU readline
for the zbx debugger. On Debian or Ubuntu these can be installed with:

  sudo apt install libsdl1.2-dev libreadline-dev

From the main directory, execute:

  make linux


To build for FreeBSD/NetBSD/OpenBSD:
------------------------------------
From the main directory, execute:

  make bsd


To build with SDL only (no X11):
--------------------------------
From the main directory, execute:

  make nox

SDLTRS will be build without the "PasteManager" ("Copy & Paste" to and
from the Emulator screen), but works on plattforms with no X11-server,
like Haiku/BeOS.


To build with SDL2:
-------------------
The SDL2 port should be considered as "experimental": it works on most
systems without flaws, but switching fullscreen mode may "clutter" the
emulator window at some time.

From the main directory, execute:

  make sdl2


To build for Win32:
-------------------
SDLTRS is designed to be build with MinGW <http://www.mingw.org/>. The
libSDL 1.2 programming package for Windows is also required, it can be
downloaded from <https://www.libsdl.org/download-1.2.php>

The runtime library (SDL.dll) should be copied to the directory of the
SDLTRS.EXE binary file, the header files of the development library to
"\MinGW\include\SDL\" and libraries to the "\MinGW\lib\" directory, or
edit the macros LIBS and INCS in the Makefile to point to the location
of the SDL installation.

From the main directory, execute:

  mingw32-make win32


To build for macOS X:
---------------------
Install libSDL2 via "MacPorts" or "Homebrew" and build the SDL2 port.
