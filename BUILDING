To build with autotools:
------------------------
From the main directory, execute:

  ./autogen.sh

which will generate the "configure" script. Installation of "aclocal",
"autoconf" and "automake" is needed for this.

To enable "readline" support for the zbx debugger, execute:

  ./configure --enable-readline

To build the old SDL 1.2 version (see below) of SDLTRS, execute:

  ./configure --enable-sdl1

To build with SDL 1.2 only (no X11 and no "PasteManager"), execute:

  ./configure --enable-sdl1 --without-x

Start build of the program by executing "make" in the main directory.


To build with SDL2:
-------------------
SDL2TRS needs the development files of libSDL 2.0 and GNU readline for
the zbx debugger. On Debian or Ubuntu these can be installed with:

  sudo apt install libsdl2-dev libreadline-dev

From the "src" directory, execute:

  make sdl2


To build for FreeBSD/NetBSD/OpenBSD with SDL 1.2:
-------------------------------------------------
From the "src" directory, execute:

  make bsd


To build with SDL 1.2 only (no X11):
-----------------------------------
From the "src" directory, execute:

  make nox

SDLTRS will be build without the "PasteManager" ("Copy & Paste" to and
from the Emulator screen), but works on operating systems with no X11-
server like Haiku/BeOS.


To build with SDL 1.2:
----------------------
SDLTRS needs the development files of libSDL 1.2, X11 and GNU readline
for the zbx debugger. On Debian or Ubuntu these can be installed with:

  sudo apt install libsdl1.2-dev libreadline-dev

From the "src" directory, execute:

  make sdl


To build for Win32 for SDL 2.0/SDL 1.2:
---------------------------------------
SDLTRS is designed to be build with MinGW <http://www.mingw.org/>. The
libSDL programming package is also required, it can be downloaded from
<https://www.libsdl.org>

The runtime library SDL2.DLL/SDL.DLL should be copied to the directory
of the SDLTRS binary file, the header files of the development library
to "\MinGW\include\SDL2" or "\MinGW\include\SDL", and libraries to the
"\MinGW\lib\" directory or edit the macros LIBS and INCS in "Makefile"
to point to the location of the SDL installation.

From the "src" directory, execute:

  mingw32-make wsdl2

to build the SDL2 version, or

  mingw32-make win32

for the old SDL 1.2 version.


To build for macOS X:
---------------------
Install libSDL2 via "MacPorts" or "Homebrew" and build SDL2 port above.
