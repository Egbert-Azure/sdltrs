To build with autotools:
------------------------
From the main directory, execute:

  ./autogen.sh

which will generate the "configure" script. Installation of "aclocal",
"autoconf" and "automake" is needed for this.

To enable "readline" support for the zbx debugger, execute:

  ./configure --enable-readline

To build the SDL2 version (see below) of SDLTRS, execute:

  ./configure --enable-sdl2

To build with SDL only (no X11 and no "PasteManager"), execute:

  ./configure --without-x

Start build of the program by executing "make" in the main directory.


To build for Linux:
-------------------
SDLTRS needs the development files of libSDL 1.2, X11 and GNU readline
for the zbx debugger. On Debian or Ubuntu these can be installed with:

  sudo apt install libsdl1.2-dev libreadline-dev

From the "src" directory, execute:

  make linux


To build for FreeBSD/NetBSD/OpenBSD:
------------------------------------
From the "src" directory, execute:

  make bsd


To build with SDL only (no X11):
--------------------------------
From the "src" directory, execute:

  make nox

SDLTRS will be build without the "PasteManager" ("Copy & Paste" to and
from the Emulator screen), but works on operating systems with no X11-
server like Haiku/BeOS.


To build with SDL2:
-------------------
SDL2TRS needs the development files of libSDL 2.0. On Debian or Ubuntu
these can be installed with:

  sudo apt install libsdl2-dev

From the "src" directory, execute:

  make sdl2


To build for Win32:
-------------------
SDLTRS is designed to be build with MinGW <http://www.mingw.org/>. The
libSDL 1.2 programming package for Windows is also required, it can be
downloaded from <https://www.libsdl.org/download-1.2.php>

The runtime library (SDL.dll) should be copied to the directory of the
SDLTRS.EXE binary file, the header files of the development library to
"\MinGW\include\SDL\" and libraries to the "\MinGW\lib\" directory, or
edit the macros LIBS and INCS in the Makefile to point to the location
of the SDL installation.

From the "src" directory, execute:

  mingw32-make win32


To build for macOS X:
---------------------
Install libSDL2 via "MacPorts" or "Homebrew" and build SDL2 port above.
