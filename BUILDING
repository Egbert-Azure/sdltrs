To build for Linux:
-------------------
SDLTRS needs the development files of libSDL 1.2, X11 and GNU readline
for the zbx debugger. On Debian or Ubuntu these can be installed with:

  sudo apt install libsdl1.2-dev libreadline-dev

From the "src/linux" directory, execute:

  make


To build for FreeBSD/NetBSD/OpenBSD:
------------------------------------
Same requirements as for Linux, but please use the GNU make (gmake) in
the "src/linux" directory. For curses (not ncurses) on NetBSD/OpenBSD,
also add "-lcurses" to LIBS in the Makefile.


To build for Win32:
-------------------
SDLTRS is designed to be build with MinGW <http://www.mingw.org/>. The
libSDL 1.2 programming package for Windows is also required, it can be
downloaded from <https://www.libsdl.org/download-1.2.php>

The runtime library (SDL.dll) should be copied to "\WINDOWS\SYSTEM32\"
directory. The header files (*.h) of the development library should be
in "\MinGW\include\SDL\" and libraries in the "\MinGW\lib\" directory.
(Or edit the macros LIBS and INCS in Makefile to point to the location
of the SDL installation)

From the "src/win32" directory, execute:

  mingw32-make


To build for Mac OS X:
----------------------
The SDL Framework needs to be placed in the "src/macosx" directory, so
that it is included in the final application. Open sdltrs.xcodeproj in
"src/macosx" directory with Xcode and build from Xcode.
